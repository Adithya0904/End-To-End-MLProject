Let’s break down your code step by step so that each part is easier to understand. This code deals with data ingestion for a machine learning project, where data is prepared for training and testing.

1. @dataclass decorator
@dataclass automatically creates methods like __init__ for the class.
Here, it's used for DataIngestionConfig to manage paths for storing training, testing, and raw data files.

2. Class DataIngestionConfig:
This class holds paths for where the data will be saved.

python
Copy code
class DataIngestionConfig:
    train_data_path: str = os.path.join('artifact', 'train.csv')
    test_data_path: str = os.path.join('artifact', 'test.csv')
    raw_data_path: str = os.path.join('artifact', 'data.csv')


train_data_path: The path where the training data will be saved (artifact/train.csv).
test_data_path: The path for the testing data (artifact/test.csv).
raw_data_path: The path for the original (raw) data (artifact/data.csv).
os.path.join() combines folder names and file names to create the full file path.

3. Class DataIngestion:
This class contains methods to read the dataset, split it into training and testing sets, and save them to the specified locations.

__init__ method:

python
Copy code
def __init__(self) -> None:
    self.ingestion_config = DataIngestionConfig()


The constructor method (__init__) creates an instance of DataIngestionConfig and stores it in self.ingestion_config. This lets you access paths like train_data_path later in the class.
initiate_data_ingestion method:
This method handles reading the dataset, splitting it into training and testing data, and saving the files.

Logging the start of data ingestion:
4. 
python
Copy code
logging.info('Entered the data ingestion method or component')


This line logs a message that the method to start data ingestion has begun. Logging helps keep track of what happens when the code runs.
Reading the dataset:
5. 
python
Copy code
df = pd.read_csv('notebook/StudentsPerformance.csv')
logging.info('Read the dataset as Dataframe')


pd.read_csv() reads a CSV file and loads the data into a pandas DataFrame, which is like a table.
The file StudentsPerformance.csv contains the data, and after it's read, a message is logged.
Creating the necessary directories:
6. 
python
Copy code
os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(self.ingestion_config.train_data_path), exist_ok=True)


os.makedirs() creates the folder if it doesn’t exist.
os.path.dirname(self.ingestion_config.train_data_path) finds the folder where the train.csv file will be stored (in this case, artifact/).
exist_ok=True ensures that it won’t throw an error if the folder already exists.
Saving the raw data:
7. 
python
Copy code
df.to_csv(self.ingestion_config.raw_data_path, index=False, header=True)


df.to_csv() saves the entire DataFrame (df) to a CSV file. The file will be stored in raw_data_path (artifact/data.csv).
index=False means row numbers won’t be written to the CSV.
header=True means the column names will be written to the CSV.
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets:
8. 
python
Copy code
train_set, test_set = train_test_split(df, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
logging.info("Train Test Split initiated")


train_test_split() splits the DataFrame into two sets: one for training (train_set) and one for testing (test_set).
test_size=0.2 means 20% of the data will be used for testing, and 80% for training.
random_state=42 ensures the split is the same every time you run the code (it makes the process reproducible).
Saving the training and testing sets:
9. 
python
Copy code
train_set.to_csv(self.ingestion_config.train_data_path, index=False, header=True)
test_set.to_csv(self.ingestion_config.test_data_path, index=False, header=True)


These two lines save the train_set and test_set as CSV files.
train_set is saved in the location specified by train_data_path (artifact/train.csv).
test_set is saved in the location specified by test_data_path (artifact/test.csv).
Logging the completion of the data ingestion:
10. 
python
Copy code
logging.info('Ingestion of the data is completed')


A log message is written to indicate that the data ingestion process is complete.
Returning the paths to the saved files:
11. 
python
Copy code
return (
    self.ingestion_config.train_data_path,
    self.ingestion_config.test_data_path
)

This returns the paths to the saved training and testing CSV files, so that they can be used later in the pipeline.
